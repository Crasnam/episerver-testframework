# Testing framework for Episerver Content Cloud

This is a project that is meant to show how to set up integration testing for Episerver Content Cloud.

The project contains code and posts  that give a description of how to build your own test framework, but there is also code that you can use directly or adapt for your needs. I might post a nuget for the framework if you would like to use it directly.

## .Net 5 public preview

Now that there is a [.NET 5 Preview for CMS 12](https://world.optimizely.com/blogs/martin-ottosen/dates/2021/6/-net-5-public-preview/), I have also posted code that shows how to set up integration testing for it. 

> But since it is a preview, there will certainly be a few changes.
