# Testing framework for Optimizely CMS

This is a project where I intend to gather information on how to work with integration testing for Optimizely CMS. I will create posts/tutorials and also add examples of code, as well as a framework that you can use to hopefully simplify it a bit.

## Posts

I have written a post that describes how to start with integration testing for Optimizely CMS 11.

## Framework

I have started a small framework that hopefully simplifies the process of starting and creating data in Optimizely CMS  so that you can then focus on writing clear test cases.

> Will maybe create a nuget for this framework if there is interest in it.
